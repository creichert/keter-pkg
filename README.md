# Command-line Keter Bundle Creator

![TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/creichert/keter-pkg)

This project is a replacement for the `yesod keter` command and
supports creating keter bundles from Haskell source code. Currently,
`keter-pkg` expects the project layout to be the same as a Yesod
scaffolded site, although we are working on supporting supporting more
flexible source layouts.

## Usage

    cd webapp/
    keter-pkg
